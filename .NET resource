OSCID
OscId is a light-weight security token service built using .NET 4.5, ASP.NET MVC4, WCF and Web API. It has out-of-the-box support for user management using the ASP.NET membership and roles provider, but provides extensibility points to integrate arbitrary user databases. Various protocols like simpleHTTP, OAuth, WsTrust handles requests, make use of the OscId engine for token issuance and emit the corresponding response. Protocol support can be extended by adding new implementations to the host and using the common engine for the heavy lifting. The core runtime takes care of enforcing security policy and token issuance whereas the data repositories abstract the underlying user and configuration store. By providing custom implementations of these repositories, OscId can be adapted to arbitrary user management and configuration systems.
